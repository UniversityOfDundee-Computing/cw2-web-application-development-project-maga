# Bookify

### Who wrote this?

We will be creating a website that takes the name of a book and returns publication information from Open Library. The application will then pass this information to a Wikipedia API that will return information about the author. The book information will also be passed to get boo excerpt from open library :

<br>Wiki: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page</br>
<br>Open Library: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api</br>
<br>Book Description: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books</br>

## How the application works
