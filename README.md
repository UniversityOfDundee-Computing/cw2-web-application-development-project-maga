We will be creating a website that takes the name of a book and returns publication information from Open Library. The application will then pass this information to a Wikipedia API that will return information about the author. The book information will also be passed to quoteable to generate a random quote from the book:

Quoteable: https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable
Wiki: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page
Open Library: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api
