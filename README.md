## Who wrote this?

We will be creating a website that takes the name of a book and returns publication information from Open Library. The application will then pass this information to a Wikipedia API that will return information about the author. The book information will also be passed to quoteable to generate a random quote from the book:

<br>Quoteable: https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable</br>
<br>Wiki: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page</br>
<br>Open Library: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api</br>
